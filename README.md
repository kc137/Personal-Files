These are the files I wrote which contains the modelling and solution of Operations Research Problems in Python.

Problems from books are taken from below: 
1. Operations Research Applications and Algorithms by Wayne L. Winston (4th Edition).
2. Applications of Optimization with Xpress-MP by Christelle Gu√©ret, Christian Prins and Marc Sevaux.

Gurobi examples taken from below link are solved in Pyomo:
